# Front-end Test Task
## Task

Develop SPA which should manage contacts. User can work with:
 - list of contacts (better with pagination)
 - contact creating (redux-form is allowed but not required)
 - contact editing
 - contact removing
 - history of calls for each contact

Front-end part should be developed as SPA with ES6, React and Redux.
Back-end API should be mocked.
